# GA Project 4 - Portfolio Site

This was my final project while I was at General Assembly. I decided to explore and experiment with a few libraries while learning React. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router, P5.js. Tone.js, Particle.js, OpenWeather API. 

## Projects

 In the site I included links to my other GA projects, which are all available to view on GtiHub. Where things got really fun though was when I started making things specifically in React. I made a number of apps: 

1. **Todo List:** A bright and simple todo list. Add items or cross them off. 
2. **Sketch:** Using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) to continuously create a random sketch with a random colour. P5 doesn't play nicely with React because of how it manipulates the DOM so I had to use a P5wrapper to make it work. 
3. **Clock**: A blurry, stylised analogue clock that fades in and out of focus. 
4. **Synth**: This was my first dabble with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) which is an incredibly powerful sound library. The frequency of the sound manipulates the display. 
5. **Arp**: Another app made with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). The is a keyboard that when clicked, adds the note to the pattern. You can choose the waveform and how the pattern will behave (up, down, down-up etc). Clear the pattern while it's playing to add melodies on top of the existing one. 
6. **Particles**: I had fun playing around with the [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) library. Click over the window for mouse interaction. 
7. **Weather**: A weather app using the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Shows the current weather, determined by user's current location. 


## Difficulties
- The main problem was using the external libraries in React. Given how React treats the DOM, it was hard learning React and these libraries at the same time. 
- Given the time constraints, I didn't manage to flesh out some of these apps as much as I would have liked. I would like to make more of a traditional synth, with ADSR sliders and detune, seperate volumes and effects. This will be something I'll carry on experimenting with. 
- I would also have liked to have a daily forecast with the weather app but unfortunately that is now a paid feature on OpenWeatherAPI now.
